# Project Overview
Full-stack application, similar in concept to X (Twitter), using Next.js for both the frontend and backend. 
The architecture follows the repository pattern to centralize and abstract the data layer, ensuring a clear separation between business logic and database communication.
The application includes API routes for selected operations, while certain functionalities use server actions as examples of direct database interaction. 
PostgreSQL will serve as the primary database, accessed through Drizzle ORM.
Authentication is implemented using NextAuth.
The UI relies on Shadcn components, wrapped with base styling to enable further customization, with all styling managed through Tailwind CSS.
